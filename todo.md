todo:

- ignore keyboard input when user has focused a text input item so that hotkey do not conflict with test input

- hide all sidebars by sliding "out" of screen to right with a small clickable tab to expand.  add "click to hide" text

- color albums on wishlist differently than tracks (different background color) so that it's more apparent to user they've wishlisted an album as opposed to a track

- somehow add config for auto-move to folder as a part of download script
