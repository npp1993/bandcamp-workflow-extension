todo:

- sidebar remember "hidden" toggle state?
- ignore keyboard input when user has focused a text input item so that hotkey do not conflict with test input

- color albums on wishlist differently than tracks (different border color) so that it's more apparent to user they've wishlisted an album as opposed to a track

- somehow add config for auto-move to folder as a part of download script
