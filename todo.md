todo:

- the "download curl script" button still appears before all download links are ready, so if the user clicks the button too early, they'll get a download script that doesn't have links to all files, and if they're not careful enough, they won't download all of their files.  how can we modify extension to ensure user downlaods all of their files after a purchase?

- change shuffle hotkey to y

- somehow add config for auto-move to folder as a part of download script
