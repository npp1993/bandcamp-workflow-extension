# Bandcamp Workflow Extension - Waveform Integration Implementation Plan

**Project**: SoundCloud-style Static Waveform Display Integration  
**Created**: June 3, 2025  
**Status**: Planning Phase  

## Overview

This document outlines the phased implementation plan for integrating a static waveform display feature into the Bandcamp Workflow Extension. The waveform will show LUFS-based amplitude visualization of currently playing tracks on release/album pages, similar to SoundCloud's interface.

## Project Architecture Analysis

### Current Extension Capabilities
- ✅ **Audio Detection**: Robust via `AudioUtils.getAudioElement()` and `AudioUtils.getWishlistAudioElement()`
- ✅ **UI Integration**: `BandcampFacade.insertBelowPlayer(element: HTMLElement)` for player insertion
- ✅ **Messaging Infrastructure**: `MessageService` for background script communication
- ✅ **Performance Optimization**: Advanced system with Phase 1/2 optimization (85-90% improvements)
- ✅ **Existing Waveform Code**: Available in `/waveform_export/` with CORS bypass implementation

### Key Integration Requirements
- **CORS Bypass**: Background script required for `https://t4.bcbits.com/stream/` audio fetching
- **Manifest Updates**: Background script configuration and host permissions
- **Service Architecture**: New `WaveformService` class for audio processing and rendering
- **Caching System**: Prevent redundant audio processing
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for audio processing failures

---

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup
**Objective**: Establish background script infrastructure and basic manifest configuration

### Tasks:
1. **Update Manifest Configuration**
   - Add background script configuration for Manifest V3
   - Add host permissions for `https://t4.bcbits.com/*`
   - Ensure proper service worker registration

2. **Create Background Script Infrastructure**
   - Integrate `waveform_background.ts` into main background script
   - Implement message handlers for audio buffer requests
   - Add error handling for CORS bypass failures

3. **Update Build Configuration**
   - Modify webpack config to compile background script
   - Ensure proper TypeScript compilation for background service worker

### Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Manifest properly registers background script
- [ ] Background script can receive and process messages
- [ ] CORS bypass successfully fetches audio from Bandcamp CDN
- [ ] No console errors in background script context

### Testing:
- Load extension in Chrome
- Verify background script registration in `chrome://extensions/`
- Test message passing between content script and background
- Verify network requests to `t4.bcbits.com` succeed

## Phase 3: UI Integration
**Objective**: Integrate waveform display into Bandcamp pages using existing facade

### Tasks:
1. **UI Component Creation**
   - Design waveform container HTML structure
   - Implement responsive CSS styling
   - Add loading states and error indicators

2. **BandcampFacade Integration**
   - Utilize `insertBelowPlayer()` method for placement
   - Handle different page types (track, album, wishlist)
   - Ensure compatibility with existing UI modifications

3. **Event System Integration**
   - Hook into existing audio event listeners
   - Update waveform display on track changes
   - Handle play/pause state visualization (optional)

### Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Waveform displays correctly below audio player
- [ ] UI responds properly on different page types
- [ ] Styling integrates seamlessly with Bandcamp's design
- [ ] No conflicts with existing extension functionality

### Testing:
- Test on track pages, album pages, and artist pages
- Verify responsive behavior on different screen sizes
- Test with existing extension features (wishlist, etc.)
- Validate CSS doesn't conflict with Bandcamp's styles

## Phase 4: Error Handling & Optimization
**Objective**: Implement robust error handling and performance optimizations

### Tasks:
1. **Error Handling Implementation**
   - Graceful fallbacks for audio processing failures
   - Network error handling for CORS requests
   - User feedback for processing states
   - Fallback UI when waveform generation fails

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Lazy loading for waveform generation
   - Debounced requests for rapid track changes
   - Memory management for audio buffers
   - Integration with existing Phase 1/2 optimization system

3. **Advanced Features**
   - Progress indication during waveform generation
   - Optional seek-to-position interaction
   - Configurable waveform appearance settings

### Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Extension handles all error scenarios gracefully
- [ ] Performance impact remains minimal
- [ ] Memory usage stays within reasonable bounds
- [ ] User experience remains smooth during processing

### Testing:
- Test with poor network conditions
- Test with corrupted/unavailable audio files
- Stress test with rapid track switching
- Monitor memory usage during extended use

## Phase 5: Testing & Polish
**Objective**: Comprehensive testing and final refinements

### Tasks:
1. **Cross-Page Testing**
   - Test on all Bandcamp page types
   - Verify compatibility with different audio formats
   - Test with various track lengths and qualities

2. **Edge Case Handling**
   - Private/restricted tracks
   - Tracks without preview streams
   - Network connectivity issues
   - Browser compatibility testing

3. **Documentation & Code Quality**
   - Update existing documentation
   - Add JSDoc comments to new services
   - Code review and refactoring
   - Performance benchmarking

### Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] All edge cases handled appropriately
- [ ] Code quality meets project standards
- [ ] Documentation is complete and accurate
- [ ] Performance benchmarks are within acceptable ranges

### Testing:
- Comprehensive manual testing on various Bandcamp pages
- Automated testing where possible
- User acceptance testing
