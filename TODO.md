TODO:

- fix q key adding full release (not seeming to work) (current item)
- add handling for release pages that do not allow you to buy individual tracks, for example #fetch https://dj-surgeon.bandcamp.com/track/part-1-9


Waveform Display
Adds a waveform display for the currently playing track that corresponds to the amplitude of a track over time.  display this waveform directly below the play bar. the user should be able to click into the waveform to seek around the track, similar as to the play bar.  this only should be implemented on release pages.
