# CORS Fix Validation - Phase 2 Waveform Implementation

**Date**: June 8, 2025  
**Issue**: HTTP 403 error when fetching audio buffers from Bandcamp CDN  
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED**

## Problem Analysis

### Original Issue
- User reported HTTP 403 error when background script attempted to fetch audio from `https://t4.bcbits.com/stream/{streamId}`
- Background script was constructing URLs using only the stream ID
- Authentication tokens and parameters were being stripped from the original audio URLs

### Root Cause
Bandcamp's audio URLs contain authentication tokens as query parameters that are required for CDN access. The original implementation was extracting only the stream ID and reconstructing a basic URL without these authentication parameters.

**Example URL formats:**
```
Original Audio URL: https://t4.bcbits.com/stream/abc123?token=xyz789&expires=1234567890
Our Previous URL: https://t4.bcbits.com/stream/abc123  ❌ Missing auth params
```

## Applied Fix

### Changes Made

#### 1. WaveformService.ts
- **Modified `generateWaveformForCurrentAudio()`**: Now passes complete `audio.src` URL to background script
- **Updated `fetchAudioBuffer()`**: Changed parameter from `streamId` to `audioUrl` and passes complete URL
- **Maintained cache key logic**: Still uses extracted stream ID for caching purposes

#### 2. background.ts
- **Removed URL construction**: No longer constructs `https://t4.bcbits.com/stream/${request.url}`
- **Direct URL usage**: Uses the provided complete URL directly in fetch request
- **Updated interface documentation**: Clarified that URL parameter contains complete authenticated URL

### Technical Details

**Before (causing 403 error):**
```typescript
// WaveformService extracting only stream ID
const streamId = this.extractStreamId(audio.src);
const audioBuffer = await this.fetchAudioBuffer(streamId);

// Background script constructing incomplete URL
const fullUrl = `https://t4.bcbits.com/stream/${request.url}`;
fetch(fullUrl) // ❌ Missing auth parameters
```

**After (should resolve 403 error):**
```typescript
// WaveformService passing complete URL
const audioBuffer = await this.fetchAudioBuffer(audio.src);

// Background script using complete URL directly
const audioUrl = request.url;
fetch(audioUrl) // ✅ Includes all auth parameters
```

## Testing Instructions

### For User Testing
1. **Load Extension**: Install the updated extension in Chrome
2. **Navigate to Bandcamp**: Visit any track page (e.g., https://artist.bandcamp.com/track/song-name)
3. **Check Console**: Open Chrome DevTools (F12) and monitor console for:
   - `[WaveformService] Generating waveform for audio URL: https://t4.bcbits.com/stream/...`
   - `[Background] Fetching audio buffer from: https://t4.bcbits.com/stream/...` (should show complete URL with params)
   - Look for successful audio buffer fetch messages instead of 403 errors
4. **Verify Waveform**: Check if waveform canvas appears below the audio player

### Expected Behavior
- ✅ No more HTTP 403 errors in console
- ✅ Background script receives complete authenticated URLs
- ✅ Audio buffer fetching succeeds
- ✅ Waveform canvas renders below player
- ✅ Cache functionality works for repeated requests

### Debug Information
If issues persist, collect:
- Complete console logs from both page and background script
- Network tab showing the actual fetch request URLs
- Any error messages in Chrome extension console

## Reference Implementation Validation

This fix aligns with the reference implementation in `waveform_export/waveform_content.ts`:
```typescript
// Reference implementation approach
const audio = document.querySelector("audio") as HTMLAudioElement | null;
const match = audio.src.match(/stream\/(.+)$/); // Extracts full stream portion including params
const streamId = match[1]; // This includes params, not just the ID

chrome.runtime.sendMessage({
  contentScriptQuery: "renderBuffer",
  url: streamId // This is actually the full stream portion with params
});
```

Our fix now matches this approach by passing the complete URL with authentication parameters.

## Next Steps

1. **User Testing**: User should test the updated extension and verify 403 errors are resolved
2. **Phase 2 Completion**: If testing is successful, Phase 2 can be marked as complete
3. **Phase 3/4**: Continue with error handling and optimization phases
4. **Documentation**: Update main implementation plan with successful completion status

---

**Build Status**: ✅ Extension builds successfully  
**File Changes**: 2 files modified (WaveformService.ts, background.ts)  
**Test Required**: User validation on live Bandcamp pages
